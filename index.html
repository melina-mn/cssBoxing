            <h2>What Is A Brand</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                A brand is a product, service or concept that is publicly distinguished from other products, 
                services or concepts so that it can be easily communicated and usually marketed.
                Branding is the process of creating and disseminating the brand name, its qualities and personality. 
                Branding could be applied to the entire corporate identity as well as to individual 
                products and services or concepts. Well-known advertising copywriter and ad agency founder David 
                Ogilvy defined a brand as: "the intangible sum of a product's attributes: its name, 
                packaging, and price, its history, its reputation, and the way it's advertised."
